# Text Generation using LSTM

## Moby-Dick is a novel by American writer Harman Melville. We have used Moby-Dick Chapter-4 dataset for training purpose.

We are using Keras,spacy,LSTM and Embedding layers in this project.

- Reading in file as a string text
- Tokenize and clean the text using spacy
- Organize into sequences of tokens (25 trained words and one target word)
- Encode sequence of words using Keras
- Create a model using Embedding, LSTM and Dense layers
- Function to generate new text
